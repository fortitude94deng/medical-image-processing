# # Image Preprocessing
# 
# To prepare the images for our network, we have to resize them to 224 x 224 and normalize each color channel by subtracting a mean value and dividing by a standard deviation. We will also augment our training data in this stage. These operations are done using image `transforms`, which prepare our data for a neural network.
# 
# ### Data Augmentation
# 
# Because there are a limited number of images, we can use image augmentation to artificially increase the number of images "seen" by the network. This means for training, we randomly resize and crop the images and also flip them horizontally. A different random transformation is applied each epoch (while training), so the network effectively sees many different versions of the same image. All of the data is also converted to Torch `Tensor`s before normalization. The validation and testing data is not augmented but is only resized and normalized. The normalization values are standardized for Imagenet. <p>
#     
# This is not necessary here but can be useful in some other data where training images are less for some categories

# We'll work with two example images and apply the train transformations.

# ## Data Iterators
# 
# To avoid loading all of the data into memory at once, we use training `DataLoaders`. First, we create a dataset object from the image folders, and then we pass these to a `DataLoader`. At training time, the `DataLoader` will load the images from disk, apply the transformations, and yield a batch. To train and validation, we'll iterate through all the batches in the respective `DataLoader`. 
# 
# One crucial aspect is to `shuffle` the data before passing it to the network. This means that the ordering of the image categories changes on each pass through the data (one pass through the data is one training epoch). 

# In[11]:


# Datasets from each folder
data = {'train':datasets.ImageFolder(root=traindir, transform=image_transforms['train']),
        'val':datasets.ImageFolder(root=validdir, transform=image_transforms['val']),
        'test':datasets.ImageFolder(root=testdir, transform=image_transforms['test'])}

# Dataloader iterators
dataloaders = {
    'train': DataLoader(data['train'], batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True),
    'val': DataLoader(data['val'], batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True),
    'test': DataLoader(data['test'], batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
}


# In[12]:


trainiter = iter(dataloaders['train'])
features, labels = next(trainiter)
features.shape, labels.shape


# The shape of a batch is `(batch_size, color_channels, height, width)`. 

# There should be 4 different classes. We can confirm this as follows.

# In[13]:


n_classes = len(cat_df)
print(f'There are {n_classes} different classes.')

len(data['train'].classes)


# We can iterate through the `DataLoaders` when doing training, validation, and testing. This construction avoids the need to load all the data into memory and also will automatically apply the transformations to each batch. On each epoch, the `Random` transformations will be different so the network will essentially see multiple versions of each training image. 

# # Pre-Trained Models for Image Classification
# 
# PyTorch has many pretrained models we can use. All of these models have been trained on Imagenet which consists of millions of images across 1000 categories. What we want to do with pretrained models is freeze the early layers, and replace the classification module with our own. 
# 
# ## Approach
# 
# The approach for using a pre-trained image recognition model is well-established:
# 
# 1. Load in pre-trained weights from a network trained on a large dataset
# 2. Freeze all the weights in the lower (convolutional) layers
#     * Layers to freeze can be adjusted depending on similarity of task to large training dataset
# 3. Replace the classifier (fully connected) part of the network with a custom classifier
#     * Number of outputs must be set equal to the number of classes
# 4. Train only the custom classifier (fully connected) layers for the task
#     * Optimizer model classifier for smaller dataset
#     
# The idea behind pre-training is the early convolutional layers of a cnn extract features that are relevant for many image recognition tasks. The later, fully-connected layers, specialize to the specific dataset by learning higher-level features. Therefore, we can use the already trained convolutional layers while training only the fully-connected layers on our own dataset. Pre-trained networks have proven to be reasonably successful for a variety of tasks, and result in a significant reduction in training time and usually increases in performance. 

# We'll be using the `vgg16`. The VGG networks had very good performance without taking a long time to train. 

# ## Process to Use Pre-Trained Model
# 
# First off, load in the model with pretrained weights. 

# In[14]:


model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
model


# The `classifier` is the part of the model that we'll train. However, for the vgg, we'll only need to train the last few layers in the classifier and not even all of the fully connected layers. 

# ### Freeze Early layers
# 
# We freeze all of the existing layers in the network by setting `requires_grad` to `False`. 

# In[15]:


# Freeze early layers
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False


# ### Add on Custom Classifier
# 
# We'll train a classifier consisting of the following layers
# 
# * Fully connected with ReLU activation (n_inputs, 256)
# * Dropout with 40% chance of dropping
# * Fully connected with log softmax output (256, n_classes)
# 
# To build our custom classifier, we use the `nn.Sequential()` module which allows us to specify each layer one after the other. We assign our custom classifier to the final `classifier` layer in the already trained vgg network. When we add on the extra layers, they are set to `require_grad=True` by default. These will be the only layers that are trained. 

# In[16]:


n_inputs = model.classifier[6].in_features

# Add on classifier
model.classifier[6] = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(n_inputs, 256), nn.ReLU(), nn.Dropout(0.4),
    nn.Linear(256, n_classes), nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1))

model.classifier


# The final output will be log probabilities which we can then use in the Negative Log Likelihood Loss. 

# In[17]:


total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())
print(f'{total_params:,} total parameters.')
total_trainable_params = sum(
    p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
print(f'{total_trainable_params:,} training parameters.')


# Even with only a few layers set to trainable, there are still over a million parameters (weights) that will be updated during training. In effect, we are _fine-tuning_ the model to work on our problem. We already know it works well on Imagenet, and because our images are relatively similar, we should expect the model to easily _transfer_ its knowledge from Imagenet to our dataset.

# ### Move to GPU 
# 
# To use a gpu in PyTorch, we simply move the whole model onto the gpu. Later we'll have to move the data to gpus in our training loop.

# # Training Loss and Optimizer
# 
# The loss is the negative log likelihood and the optimizer is the Adam optimizer. The negative log likelihood in PyTorch expects log probabilities so we need to pass it the raw output from the log softmax in our model's final layer. The optimizer is told to optimizer the model parameters (only a few of which require a gradient). 
# 
# * Loss (criterion): keeps track of the loss itself and the gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters (weights)
# * Optimizer: updates the parameters (weights) with the gradients 

# In[24]:


criterion = nn.NLLLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())


# Below we can look at the parameters (weights) that will be updated by the optimizer during training.

# In[25]:


for p in optimizer.param_groups[0]['params']:
    if p.requires_grad:
        print(p.shape)


# # Training
# 
# For training, we iterate through the train `DataLoader`, each time passing one batch through the model. One complete pass through the training data is known as an `epoch`, and we train for a set number of epochs or until early stopping kicks in (more below). After each batch, we calculate the loss (with `criterion(output, targets)`) and then calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters with `loss.backward()`. This uses autodifferentiation and backpropagation to calculate the gradients. 
# 
# After calculating the gradients, we call `optimizer.step()` to update the model parameters with the gradients. This is done on every training batch so we are implementing stochastic gradient descent (or rather a version of it with momentum known as Adam). For each batch, we also compute the accuracy for monitoring and after the training loop has completed, we start the validation loop. This will be used to carry out early stopping.
# 
# 
# ## Early Stopping
# 
# Early stopping halts the training when the validation loss has not decreased for a number of epochs. Each time the validation loss does decrease, the model weights are saved so we can later load in the best model. Early stopping is an effective method to prevent overfitting on the training data. If we continue training, the training loss will continue to decrease, but the validation loss will increase because the model is starting to memorize the training data. Early stopping prevents this from happening, and, if we save the model each epoch when the validation loss decreases, we are able to retrieve the model that does best on the validation data.
# 
# Early stopping is implemented by iterating through the validation data at the end of each training epoch and calculating the loss. We use the complete validation data every time and record whether or not the loss has decreased. If it has not for a number of epochs, we stop training, retrieve the best weights, and return them. When in the validation loop, we make sure not to update the model parameters. 
# 
# ### Training Function

# The below function trains the network while monitoring a number of different parameters. We train with early stopping on the validation set. There are a number of parameters that I've tried to explain in the doc string. Hopefully, the comments and background make things somewhat understandable!
